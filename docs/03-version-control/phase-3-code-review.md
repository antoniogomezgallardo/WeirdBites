# Phase 3: Code Review Standards

**Version**: 0.1.0 (Draft)
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**
**Pull Request**: TBD

---

## Overview

Phase 3 will establish **code review standards and best practices** to ensure consistent, high-quality code reviews across the project.

### Goals

- [ ] Create code review checklist template
- [ ] Define review quality standards
- [ ] Document review best practices
- [ ] Set up automated review reminders (optional)
- [ ] Establish review response time expectations

### Planned Implementation

**Target Date**: TBD
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 days (~5-8 hours)

---

## Planned Components

### 1. Code Review Checklist

**Purpose**: Standardize what reviewers should check

**Planned Sections**:

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, readable, maintainable?
- [ ] **Testing**: Are there adequate tests? Do they pass?
- [ ] **Security**: Any security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Performance**: Any performance concerns?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is code documented? README updated?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Are errors handled properly?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases considered?

### 2. Review Quality Standards

**Purpose**: Define what makes a good review

**Planned Guidelines**:

- Response time expectations (24-48 hours)
- Review depth requirements
- Constructive feedback approach
- Approval criteria

### 3. Review Best Practices

**Purpose**: Help reviewers conduct effective reviews

**Planned Topics**:

- How to give constructive feedback
- How to review large PRs
- When to request changes vs. approve
- How to handle disagreements

### 4. CODEOWNERS File (Optional)

**Purpose**: Automatically request reviews from relevant team members

**Example** (`.github/CODEOWNERS`):

```
# Default owners for everything
* @antoniogomezgallardo

# Frontend code
/src/app/ @antoniogomezgallardo
/src/components/ @antoniogomezgallardo

# Backend code
/src/api/ @antoniogomezgallardo

# Documentation
/docs/ @antoniogomezgallardo
```

## Why This Matters

### Benefits of Code Review

**Quality Improvements**:

- ✅ Catches bugs before production
- ✅ Ensures code meets standards
- ✅ Maintains consistent style

**Knowledge Sharing**:

- ✅ Team learns from each other
- ✅ Spread domain knowledge
- ✅ Onboard new team members faster

**Collaboration**:

- ✅ Encourages discussion
- ✅ Builds team culture
- ✅ Improves communication

### Industry Data

- **Google**: All code is reviewed before merge
- **Microsoft**: Code reviews reduce defects by 40-60%
- **GitHub**: 95% of top projects require reviews

## Placeholder Resources

### Templates (To Be Created)

1. **Review Checklist Template**
   - Markdown file for PR reviews
   - Copy-paste into PR comments

2. **Review Guide**
   - How to conduct reviews
   - Examples of good/bad feedback

3. **Self-Review Checklist**
   - For PR authors before requesting review
   - Reduces back-and-forth

### GitHub Settings (To Be Configured)

1. **Branch Protection**
   - Require 1 approval (already configured)
   - Can increase to 2 for sensitive changes

2. **Review Assignment**
   - Auto-assign reviewers
   - Load balancing

3. **Review Reminders**
   - Slack/email notifications
   - Stale PR alerts

## Decision: Why Not Implemented Yet

**Rationale**:

- Project is solo development (no team yet)
- Review requirements already configured (1 approval)
- Can self-review using PR template checklist
- Phase 3 can be implemented when:
  - Team grows to 2+ developers
  - Code review becomes bottleneck
  - Consistency issues appear

**Current Workflow**:

- Self-review using PR template
- Verify all quality gates pass
- Merge when confident

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ⏳ **PENDING**
**Priority**: Low (solo development)
**Estimated Effort**: 5-8 hours
