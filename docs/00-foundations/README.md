## What's in This Module

### Quality Framework

Defines our approach to quality and agile development:

- **Sprint Structure**: 1-week sprints, 10-15 story points capacity
- **Ceremonies**: Planning, Standup, Review, Retrospective, Refinement
- **Quality Policy**: 6 core principles, quality standards, quality gates
- **Continuous Improvement**: Metrics review, process experiments

### ISO 25010 Quality Mapping

Maps all WeirdBites features to ISO 25010 quality model:

- **8 Quality Characteristics**: Functional Suitability, Performance, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Portability
- **31 Sub-characteristics**: Complete coverage matrix
- **Quality Coverage**: 93% overall (excellent)
- **Traceability**: User stories and NFRs mapped to quality characteristics
