## 12. Quality Framework

### 12.1 Agile Framework Selection

**Framework**: **Hybrid Scrum/Kanban** (Scrumban)

**Rationale**:
- **Solo Developer Context**: Traditional Scrum is team-focused; adaptation needed for single-person project
- **Educational Purpose**: Demonstrates understanding of both frameworks
- **Flexibility**: Kanban's flow-based approach suits varying story sizes
- **Structure**: Scrum's time-boxed sprints provide rhythm and reflection points

### 12.2 Sprint Structure

**Sprint Duration**: **1 week** (Monday - Sunday)

**Rationale**:
- Faster feedback loops than 2-week sprints
- Aligns with vertical slice delivery (most slices are 1-2 weeks)
- Weekly retrospectives enable rapid process improvement
- Reduces planning overhead for solo developer

**Sprint Capacity**: **10-15 story points**
- Based on 20-30 hours/week development time (part-time while learning)
- Includes buffer for learning, documentation, quality activities

### 12.3 Scrum Ceremonies (Adapted for Solo Developer)

| Ceremony | Cadence | Duration | Purpose | Adaptation |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Sprint Planning** | Monday (start of sprint) | 30-60 min | Select stories, define sprint goal | Solo planning with DoR checklist |
| **Daily Standup** | Daily (morning) | 5-10 min | Review progress, identify blockers | Written daily log or voice memo |
| **Sprint Review** | Sunday (end of sprint) | 30-45 min | Demo completed work | Record demo video, share with peers/mentors |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Sunday (after review) | 30-45 min | Reflect and improve | Written retrospective using template |
| **Backlog Refinement** | Mid-week (Wednesday) | 30-60 min | Prepare upcoming stories | Apply DoR checklist, estimate, clarify |

**Total Ceremony Time**: ~3-4 hours/week (~15-20% of development time)

### 12.4 Kanban Elements

**Board Columns**:
1. **Backlog** - Prioritized stories ready for development
2. **Ready** - Stories meeting Definition of Ready
3. **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **In Review** - Code review, waiting for CI
5. **Testing** - E2E testing, QA validation
6. **Done** - Meets Definition of Done, deployed

**WIP Limits**:
- **In Progress**: 1-2 stories (focus on completing, not starting)
- **In Review**: 2 stories max (prevent review bottleneck)
- **Testing**: 1 story (quality gate)

**Lead Time Target**: <3 days (from "Ready" to "Done")

**Cycle Time Target**: <2 days (from "In Progress" to "Done")

### 12.5 Sprint Workflow

**Week Structure**:

**Monday (Sprint Planning)**:
1. Review last sprint (what completed, what didn't, why)
2. Set sprint goal (aligned with vertical slice)
3. Select stories from "Ready" column (10-15 points)
4. Break stories into tasks (if needed)
5. Commit to sprint backlog

**Tuesday-Thursday (Development)**:
1. Morning standup (5 min written log)
2. Work on highest priority story
3. Follow TDD/BDD practices
4. Commit frequently with meaningful messages
5. Update story status on board

**Wednesday (Refinement)**:
1. Review upcoming stories (next 2-3 sprints)
2. Apply Definition of Ready checklist
3. Estimate new stories (planning poker with confidence level)
4. Clarify acceptance criteria
5. Update priorities if needed

**Friday (Quality Focus)**:
1. Code review of week's PRs
2. Run full test suite
3. Address technical debt
4. Update documentation
5. Prepare for demo

**Sunday (Review & Retrospective)**:
1. **Sprint Review** (30-45 min):
   - Record demo of completed work
   - Verify Definition of Done met
   - Update metrics (velocity, burndown)
   - Share with peers/mentors for feedback

2. **Sprint Retrospective** (30-45 min):
   - What went well? (successes, learnings)
   - What needs improvement? (bottlenecks, pain points)
   - Action items (max 3, specific, measurable)
   - Update process documentation

### 12.6 Quality Framework Integration

**Quality Built Into Framework**:

**Sprint Planning**:
- Story must meet Definition of Ready (quality gate #1)
- Test cases identified during planning
- Performance/security considerations discussed

**Development**:
- TDD/BDD: Write tests first (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Continuous integration: Every commit runs CI pipeline
- Code review: All code reviewed before merge

**Sprint Review**:
- Demo on production (or staging identical to production)
- Verify non-functional requirements (performance, accessibility)
- User acceptance (based on acceptance criteria)

**Retrospective**:
- Review quality metrics (coverage, DORA, performance)
- Identify quality process improvements
- Update Definition of Done if needed

### 12.7 Tools & Automation

**Project Management**:
- **Tool**: GitHub Projects (Kanban board)
- **Automation**: Issues move columns based on PR/commit status
- **Metrics**: Velocity, cycle time, burndown (tracked in spreadsheet)

**Development**:
- **IDE**: VS Code with extensions (ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Playwright)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub (GitFlow branching)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (automated quality gates)

**Communication** (Solo):
- **Daily Log**: Markdown file tracking progress, blockers, learnings
- **Sprint Journal**: Weekly summary (what shipped, what learned)
- **Demo Videos**: Loom/OBS recordings of sprint reviews

**Metrics Dashboard**:
- **Tool**: Google Sheets or GitHub Projects Insights
- **Metrics**: Velocity, cycle time, code coverage, DORA metrics
- **Review Cadence**: Weekly (sprint retrospective)

### 12.8 Scaling & Adaptation

**As Project Grows**:
- **Add collaborators**: Transition to full Scrum with team ceremonies
- **Increase sprint duration**: Move to 2-week sprints if stories grow
- **Add roles**: Product Owner (stakeholder), Scrum Master (process facilitator)
- **Upgrade tools**: Migrate to Jira/Linear if GitHub Projects insufficient

**Framework Flexibility**:
- Framework is a guide, not a religion
- Adapt based on what works (measure and iterate)
- Document changes in retrospectives
- Keep what adds value, drop what doesn't

## 13. Quality Policy

### 13.1 Quality Policy Statement

**WeirdBites Quality Commitment**: We are committed to delivering a high-quality e-commerce platform that demonstrates professional software engineering excellence through measurable quality standards and continuous improvement.

### 13.2 Core Quality Principles

We commit to the following quality principles (aligned with the Code Quality Manifesto from quality-standards):

1. **Quality is Everyone's Responsibility**
   - Quality is not just the QA team's job—it's built into every phase
   - Every commit must meet quality standards before merge

2. **Prevention over Detection**
   - Build quality in from requirements, not test it in later
   - Use TDD/BDD to prevent defects, not just find them

3. **Automation over Manual Repetition**
   - Automate everything that can be automated
   - Manual testing reserved for exploratory and usability testing

4. **Continuous Improvement over Perfection**
   - Progress, not paralysis—ship iteratively
   - Learn from failures and improve processes

5. **Data-Driven Decisions over Opinions**
   - Metrics guide our development path
   - Track DORA metrics, test coverage, performance

6. **User Value over Technical Excellence**
   - Users define quality through their experience
   - Accessibility, performance, usability are non-negotiable
