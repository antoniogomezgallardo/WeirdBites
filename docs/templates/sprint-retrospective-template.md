## Retrospective Best Practices

**Do's**:
‚úÖ Focus on the process, not individuals
‚úÖ Use data (metrics) to support discussions
‚úÖ Keep it timeboxed (30-45 minutes)
‚úÖ Generate 3-5 actionable improvements
‚úÖ Follow up on previous action items
‚úÖ Celebrate wins (not just problems)
‚úÖ Use different formats to keep it fresh
‚úÖ Document and share retrospective notes

**Don'ts**:
‚ùå Blame individuals for issues
‚ùå Rehash the same problems without action
‚ùå Skip retrospectives (even if sprint went great)
‚ùå Create too many action items (max 5)
‚ùå Let one person dominate the discussion
‚ùå Ignore metrics and data
‚ùå Focus only on negatives
‚ùå Skip follow-up on action items

---

## Solo Developer Adaptation

**For single-person projects**:

**Reflection Questions**:
1. What did I learn this sprint?
2. What would I do differently next time?
3. What tools or practices helped me most?
4. Where did I waste time?
5. What am I proud of?

**Simplified Process**:
- Set timer for 30 minutes
- Review metrics honestly
- List 3 things that went well
- List 3 things to improve
- Pick 1-2 actions for next sprint
- Update process docs if needed

**Alternative**: Record a video retrospective explaining the sprint to an imaginary team member. Teaching forces reflection!
