**Notes**:

- `app/` root files (layout, page) are tested via E2E, not captured by Jest
- Low function coverage in `config/` due to unused helper functions

## 3. Test Count Trends

### 3.1 Test Growth Over Time

| Week       | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Total Tests | Growth      |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Week 1** | 30         | 8                 | 4         | 42          | -           |

**Total Growth**: 42 → 344 tests (819% increase in 6 weeks)

**Average Growth**: ~50 tests per week

---

### 3.2 Test Pyramid Distribution

**Week 6 (Current)**:

- Unit: 257 (74.7%)
- Integration: 52 (15.1%)
- E2E: 35 (10.2%)

**Target Distribution**:

- Unit: 70%
- Integration: 20%
- E2E: 10%

**Status**: ✅ **Aligned with test pyramid** (minor integration gap)

**Action**: Add 17 more integration tests to reach 20% target

---

## 4. Coverage Quality Analysis

### 4.1 Meaningful Coverage vs Coverage Gaming

**Quality Indicators**:

- ✅ All tests use specific assertions (not generic `toBeTruthy()`)
- ✅ Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- ✅ Edge cases explicitly tested (empty arrays, null values, errors)
- ✅ Tests have descriptive names

**Red Flags** (None detected):

- ❌ Tests that don't assert anything (0 found)
- ❌ Tests with only generic assertions (0 found)
- ❌ Tests that execute code without verifying behavior (0 found)

**Coverage Quality Score**: ✅ **High** (coverage is meaningful, not gamed)

---

### 4.2 Mutation Testing (Future Enhancement)

**What**: Change code (mutate) and verify tests fail

**Status**: ⏳ **Not implemented** (planned for post-MVP)

**Tool**: Stryker Mutator for JavaScript

**Purpose**: Verify that 84.91% coverage actually catches bugs

---

## 5. Coverage Gaps & Action Items

### 5.1 Current Gaps (Week 6)

**Gap 1: Function Coverage Below 80%**

- Current: 77.14%
- Target: 80%
- Gap: -2.86%
- **Root Cause**: `config/features.ts` (33.33%), `pagination.tsx` (66.66%)
- **Action**: Test all exported functions
- **Priority**: High
- **Target Week**: Week 7

**Gap 2: Integration Test Distribution Low**

- Current: 15.1%
- Target: 20%
- Gap: -4.9%
- **Root Cause**: Need more API route tests
- **Action**: Add 17 integration tests for cart/checkout APIs (US-004 to US-010)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Target Week**: Weeks 8-10 (as features implemented)

**Gap 3: Uncovered Error Scenarios**

- Current: Error handling not fully tested
- **Root Cause**: Focus on happy path testing
- **Action**: Add tests for all error scenarios (404, 500, validation errors)
- **Priority**: High
- **Target Week**: Week 7

---

### 5.2 Action Items for Week 7

**Priority 1** (Function Coverage to 80%):

- [ ] Test all functions in `config/features.ts`
- [ ] Test all functions in `components/pagination.tsx`
- [ ] Test all functions in `product-image-with-lightbox.tsx`
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Expected Coverage Gain**: +3%

**Priority 2** (Error Scenario Coverage):

- [ ] Add integration tests for API error handling (database failures)
- [ ] Add unit tests for invalid input edge cases
- [ ] Add E2E tests for 404 pages
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours
- **Expected Coverage Gain**: +2%

**Priority 3** (Update Coverage Thresholds):

- [ ] Update `jest.config.ts` thresholds from 18% to 80%
- [ ] Configure CI to fail if coverage drops below 80%
- **Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes
- **Expected Coverage Gain**: 0% (but enforces floor)

---

## 6. Coverage Enforcement

### 6.1 Current Thresholds (jest.config.ts)

**As of Week 6**:

```typescript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 40,
    functions: 30,
    lines: 18,
    statements: 18,
  },
}
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **TOO LOW** (historical artifact from early development)

**Current Coverage**: Far exceeds these thresholds (84.91% vs 18%)

---

### 6.2 Recommended Threshold Update

**Proposed**:

```typescript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 80,      // Currently 87.57% ✅
    functions: 75,     // Currently 77.14% ✅ (buffer for growth)
    lines: 80,         // Currently 84.91% ✅
    statements: 80,    // Currently 84.91% ✅
  },
}
```

**Rationale**:

- Sets floor at current levels (prevents regression)
- Allows 5% buffer for function coverage (room to add new untested functions)
- Aligns with industry standard (80% coverage target)

**Action**: Update in Week 7

---

### 6.3 CI/CD Enforcement

**Current**: Coverage checked in CI but thresholds not enforced (too low)

**Proposed**:

1. Update thresholds to 80%
2. CI fails if coverage drops below threshold
3. Developers must add tests before merging

**Benefit**: Prevents coverage regression

---

## 7. Weekly Reporting Process

### 7.1 How to Generate Weekly Report

**Every Friday**:

1. **Run Coverage Report**:

   ```bash
   pnpm test:coverage
   ```

2. **Copy Coverage Metrics**:
   - From terminal output: Statement %, Branch %, Function %, Line %
   - From `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`: Uncovered lines per file

3. **Update This Document**:
   - Add new row to "Weekly Coverage History" table (Section 1.1)
   - Update "Coverage by Module" table (Section 2.1)
   - Update "Uncovered Code Hotspots" (Section 2.2)
   - Update "Test Count Trends" table (Section 3.1)

4. **Identify Action Items**:
   - Review uncovered code
   - Create GitHub issues for missing tests
   - Assign priorities (High/Medium/Low)

5. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/09-metrics-monitoring/coverage-tracking.md
   git commit -m "docs(metrics): update coverage tracking for week X"
   git push
   ```

**Time Required**: ~15-20 minutes per week

---

## 8. Coverage Best Practices

### 8.1 DO's

- ✅ Write tests BEFORE code (TDD)
- ✅ Aim for 80-90% coverage (pragmatic balance)
- ✅ Test edge cases (empty, null, invalid input)
- ✅ Test error scenarios (404, 500, validation errors)
- ✅ Run coverage locally before pushing (`pnpm test:coverage`)
- ✅ Review HTML coverage report (see visual gaps)

### 8.2 DON'Ts

- ❌ Chase 100% coverage (diminishing returns)
- ❌ Write tests just to increase coverage (test quality > quantity)
- ❌ Ignore uncovered code (investigate why it's untested)
- ❌ Lower thresholds to pass CI (fix tests instead)
- ❌ Skip testing error paths (they're important!)
