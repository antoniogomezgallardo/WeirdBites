# WeirdBites - Project Kickoff Checklist

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Purpose**: Simple, direct checklist of what you need before starting development

## What is This?

This is a **dead-simple checklist** that answers one question:

> **"What do I need before I start coding?"**

If you're new to the project, **start here**. Then read the other docs.

## Common Questions

### Q: How long does setup (Slice 0) take?

**A**: 3-5 days if you're learning the tools. 1-2 days if you're experienced.

### Q: Can I skip reading the documentation?

**A**: No! The documentation is **part of the learning**. Demonstrates:
- Requirements engineering skills
- Business analysis skills
- Agile planning skills
- Portfolio quality

### Q: What if I get stuck?

**A**:
1. Check the specific document (e.g., Project Setup for environment issues)
2. Check README.md "Common Issues" section
3. Check GitHub Issues for similar problems
4. Ask for help (document your issue clearly)

### Q: Do I need to read ALL documents before coding?

**A**: **Core** (must read): 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, wireframes/slice-1 (~3.5 hours)
**Optional** (read as needed): 1, 2, 4
**For Sprint Planning**: 16, 17, templates/sprint-planning (~40 min)
**For Testing**: 13, 14 (~35 min)

### Q: Can I start coding before Slice 0 is done?

**A**: **NO**. Slice 0 is the foundation. Starting without it means:
- No tests ‚Üí Can't verify code works
- No CI/CD ‚Üí Can't deploy
- No database ‚Üí Can't store data
- Wasted time fixing later

### Q: What if the checklist seems overwhelming?

**A**: Break it down:
- **Day 1**: Read docs (2-3 hours)
- **Day 2**: Start Slice 0 setup
- **Day 3**: Finish Slice 0, verify everything
- **Day 4**: Start Slice 1!

It's normal to feel overwhelmed. Take it one checkbox at a time.
