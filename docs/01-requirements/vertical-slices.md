# WeirdBites - Vertical Slices Implementation Plan

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Purpose**: Define thin, deployable increments that deliver end-to-end value
**Reference**: Module 01 - Vertical Slicing

---

## 1. What is Vertical Slicing?

**Vertical slicing** is the practice of splitting user stories into thin, end-to-end increments that cross all architectural layers (UI → API → Database) and deliver working, valuable functionality. Each slice is independently deployable and testable.

**Key Relationship**: User Stories are **split into** Vertical Slices, not the other way around.

- ✅ Correct: "US-001 is split into Vertical Slices 1.1, 1.2, 1.3"
- ❌ Incorrect: "Vertical Slice 1 contains US-001, US-002, US-003"

### 1.1 Why Vertical Slices?

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **Faster feedback**: Deploy and validate each slice
- ✅ **Reduced risk**: Spread risk across iterations
- ✅ **Continuous value**: Something useful after each slice
- ✅ **Better estimation**: Small slices are easier to estimate
- ✅ **Early integration**: No "big bang" integration at the end

### 1.2 Vertical vs Horizontal Slicing

```
❌ HORIZONTAL (Anti-Pattern):
Sprint 1: Database schema for all features
Sprint 2: All API endpoints
Sprint 3: All UI components
Sprint 4: Integration (value only here!)

✅ VERTICAL (Best Practice):
Sprint 1: Browse Products (DB + API + UI) → Delivers value!
Sprint 2: Shopping Cart (DB + API + UI) → Delivers value!
Sprint 3: Checkout (DB + API + UI) → Delivers value!
```

## 2. WeirdBites Vertical Slices

### Overview

WeirdBites MVP will be built in **7 deployment increments**, where each increment is composed of multiple vertical slices derived by splitting user stories. Each deployment increment delivers working, valuable functionality across all architectural layers.

| Deployment<br>Increment | Name                          | Duration | Story Points<br>(from split stories) | Value Delivered           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1                       | Browse Products               | 2 weeks  | 13                                   | Product discovery         |
| 2                       | Shopping Cart                 | 1 week   | 13                                   | Cart management           |
| 3                       | Guest Checkout                | 2 weeks  | 19                                   | Complete purchase flow    |
| 4                       | User Accounts                 | 1 week   | 16                                   | Authentication & profiles |
| 5                       | Registered Checkout & History | 1 week   | 11                                   | Enhanced user experience  |
| 6                       | Search & Reviews              | 1 week   | 13                                   | Discovery & social proof  |
| 7                       | Admin Panel                   | 2 weeks  | 50                                   | Platform management       |

**Total**: 10-12 weeks | 135 story points

**Note**: Each deployment increment contains multiple vertical slices created by splitting user stories. Story points represent the estimated effort for all slices within that increment.

---

## 3. Deployment Increment 1: Browse Products (Guest) 🍕

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Story Points**: 13 (aggregate from split stories)
**Goal**: Users can discover weird snack products

**Composition**: This deployment increment contains vertical slices derived by splitting US-001, US-002, and US-003 across all architectural layers.

### 3.1 Value Delivered

After Deployment Increment 1, users can:

- Visit WeirdBites.com
- Browse product catalog (grid view)
- View product details
- Filter by category
- Experience responsive design (mobile/desktop)

### 3.2 Layers Implemented

**Frontend (Next.js)**:

- Homepage with product grid
- Product detail page
- Category filter component
- Loading states, error handling
- Responsive layout

**Backend (API Routes)**:

- `GET /api/products` - List products (paginated)
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Product details
- `GET /api/categories` - List categories

**Database (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  category VARCHAR(100),
  images JSONB, -- array of image URLs
  ingredients TEXT,
  nutrition_facts JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_name ON products(name); -- for search later
```

### 3.3 Derived from User Stories

This slice represents the first deployable increment derived by splitting these user stories:

- US-001: Browse Product Catalog (5 pts) - Split into thin vertical slice for basic browsing
- US-002: View Product Details (5 pts) - Split into thin vertical slice for basic product view
- US-003: Filter by Category (3 pts) - Split into thin vertical slice for basic filtering

**Note**: Each user story may be split into multiple vertical slices. This slice implements the minimal viable increment for product discovery.

### 3.4 Testing

- **Integration**: API endpoints return correct data
- **E2E**: Browse products → click product → view details → filter

### 3.5 Acceptance Criteria

## 10. Deployment Strategy

### 10.1 Per-Slice Deployment

**After each slice**:

1. ✅ All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
2. ✅ Code reviewed (self-review + quality checklist)
3. ✅ Security scan clean (npm audit)
4. ✅ Lighthouse score > 90
5. ✅ Deploy to Vercel staging
6. ✅ Smoke test on staging
7. ✅ Deploy to production
8. ✅ Verify in production
9. ✅ Document in CHANGELOG.md

### 10.2 Feature Flags (Optional)

For slices 3+, consider feature flags to deploy behind toggle:

```typescript
// Example
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  enableCheckout: process.env.FEATURE_CHECKOUT === 'true',
  enableReviews: process.env.FEATURE_REVIEWS === 'true',
  enableAdminPanel: process.env.FEATURE_ADMIN === 'true',
};
```

**Benefits**:

- Deploy code without exposing feature
- Test in production safely
- Gradual rollout
- Easy rollback

---

## 11. Success Criteria per Slice

- [ ] All vertical slices (derived from split stories) meet acceptance criteria
- [ ] All layers implemented (UI, API, DB)
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] Unit tests ≥80% coverage (new code)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] E2E test for critical path

- [ ] Smoke tested in production

---

## 12. Risk Mitigation

### Per-Slice Risks

**Slice 1**: Learning Next.js App Router

- Mitigation: Tutorials, documentation, simple implementation first

**Slice 2**: Cart persistence strategy

- Mitigation: Start with localStorage, can upgrade to DB later

**Slice 3**: Stripe integration complexity

- Mitigation: Use test mode, follow official docs, limit to basic flow

**Slice 4**: Authentication security

- Mitigation: Use established patterns (NextAuth.js or bcrypt + JWT)

**Slice 5**: Order-user linking

- Mitigation: Simple foreign key, no complex logic

**Slice 6**: Search performance

- Mitigation: Basic SQL LIKE, can upgrade to full-text later

**Slice 7**: Admin complexity

- Mitigation: Break into sub-slices if needed
