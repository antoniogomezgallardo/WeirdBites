## Anti-Personas (Not Our Target Users)

### Anti-Persona 1: Bargain Hunter

**Why Not Target**: Weird/unique snacks are niche and premium-priced. Users primarily seeking lowest prices won't value our USP.

### Anti-Persona 2: Health-Focused Shopper

**Why Not Target**: Many weird snacks are novelty items, not health foods. Users seeking organic/low-calorie won't find what they need.

### Anti-Persona 3: Bulk Business Buyer

**Why Not Target**: This is a consumer-focused platform, not B2B. No wholesale pricing or bulk ordering features.
