## 6. Testing Strategy Summary

### 6.1 Test Pyramid

**Target Distribution**:
```
        /\
       /  \  E2E Tests (10%)
      /____\
     /      \
    / Integration \ Integration Tests (20%)
   /___Tests______\
  /                \
 /   Unit Tests     \ Unit Tests (70%)
/____________________\
```

**Why This Distribution?**:
- **Unit tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated, easy to maintain
- **Integration tests (20%)**: Verify module interactions
- **E2E tests (10%)**: Verify critical user journeys

### 6.2 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Process**:
1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality

**Application**:
- All new features developed using TDD
- Tests written BEFORE implementation
- Refactoring guided by test safety net

### 6.3 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Process**:
1. Define acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
2. Write executable specifications
3. Implement feature to satisfy specifications

**Application**:
- User stories already have Given-When-Then acceptance criteria
- Convert AC to executable tests (Cucumber/Jest)
- Validate feature against AC

### 6.4 Quality Gates

**Pre-Merge Gates** (PR must pass):
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Code coverage ≥80% for new code
- ✅ No ESLint/TypeScript errors
- ✅ No critical/high security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Accessibility tests passing

```typescript
// fixtures/products.ts
export const mockProducts = [
  { id: 1, name: "Wasabi Kit Kat", price: 4.99, ... },
  { id: 2, name: "Durian Candy", price: 3.49, ... },
];

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

### 8.1 Testing Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Low test coverage** | High defect rate | Medium | Enforce 80% coverage gate |
| **Flaky E2E tests** | False failures, wasted time | High | Use explicit waits, retry logic |
| **Slow test execution** | Delayed feedback | Medium | Parallelize tests, optimize fixtures |
| **Insufficient test types** | Missed defects | Medium | Implement full test pyramid |
| **No CI/CD integration** | Manual testing overhead | Low | Set up GitHub Actions early (Slice 0) |
| **Poor test data** | Brittle tests | Medium | Use factories, not hardcoded data |
| **Skipped testing** | Technical debt | Low | Make testing part of DoD |

### 8.2 Mitigation Plan

**High Priority**:
1. **Set up CI/CD in Slice 0** - Prevents manual testing overhead
2. **Enforce coverage gates** - Prevents low coverage from accumulating
3. **Use TDD from Slice 1** - Prevents skipped testing

**Medium Priority**:
4. **Monitor flaky test rate** - Track and fix flaky tests weekly
5. **Optimize test execution** - Keep feedback loop fast (<5 min)
6. **Implement test pyramid** - Ensure balanced test distribution
