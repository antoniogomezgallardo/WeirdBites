## 📖 Key Concepts Explained

### What is a BRD (Business Requirements Document)?

A BRD captures the **business context** for why we're building this project (goals, stakeholders, scope, constraints, success metrics).

**See**: [01-requirements/business-requirements.md](01-requirements/business-requirements.md)

### What are User Personas?

Fictional but realistic representations of target users with demographics, goals, behaviors, and pain points.

**WeirdBites has 4 personas**: Sarah (Curious Snacker), Marcus (Gift Giver), Emma (Food Blogger), Antonio (Admin)

**See**: [01-requirements/personas.md](01-requirements/personas.md)

### What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

The simplest version of the product that delivers core value and can be released.

**WeirdBites MVP**: 35 Must Have user stories across 7 vertical slices

**See**: [01-requirements/mvp-definition.md](01-requirements/mvp-definition.md)

### What are Vertical Slices?

Thin, end-to-end increments created by **splitting user stories** across all architectural layers (UI → API → Database) to deliver working functionality incrementally.

**WeirdBites has 7 deployment increments** composed of vertical slices derived from 35+ user stories.

**See**: [01-requirements/vertical-slices.md](01-requirements/vertical-slices.md)

### Vertical Slices vs User Stories?

**Key Relationship**: User Stories are **split into** Vertical Slices

- **User Story** = A feature requirement that describes user value (1-8 story points)
- **Vertical Slice** = A thin, deployable increment created by splitting a user story across all layers
- **Deployment Increment** = A collection of vertical slices (from multiple split stories) delivered together (10-20 points)

**Example**:

- ✅ Correct: "US-001 (Browse Products) is split into vertical slices for listing, filtering, and pagination"
- ❌ Incorrect: "Deployment Increment 1 contains US-001, US-002, US-003"

Both slices and stories cross all layers, but slices are the result of splitting stories for incremental delivery.

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Why are docs organized in module folders?

**A**: We align with the [quality-standards](quality-standards/) framework (Modules 00-16) for consistency, scalability, and clear separation of concerns.

### Q: Do I need to read ALL documents before coding?

**A**: **No**. Core reading (~3 hours): START-HERE, README, CLAUDE, Module 01 docs, Module 02 DoR, Slice 1 wireframes, Project Setup.

Optional: Read other docs as needed during development.

### Q: Can I skip Project Setup (Slice 0)?

**A**: **NO**. Slice 0 is the foundation. Without it, you have no tests, no CI/CD, no database → wasted time fixing later.

### Q: Where are the templates?

**A**: Sprint templates in [02-agile-planning/templates/](02-agile-planning/templates/)

- sprint-planning.md
- sprint-retrospective.md

### Q: How do I navigate between modules?

**A**: Each module folder has a README.md with navigation links. Or use this START-HERE.md as your hub.
